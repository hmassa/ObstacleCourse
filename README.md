# Relay Runner

## About
Relay runner is an obstacle course game created with Unity as a final project for CS4610 - Computer Graphics. 

## Objective  
Get past all of the obstacles and to the end of the course before the timer runs out.

## How to Play
The game will start with the character falling into the scene. When the countdown timer goes off, players can move their character using these keys:  
* W - run forward
* A - run left
* S - run backwards
* D - run right
* Space - jump
* Return - roll

In order to complete the level successfully, players must run off the edge of the track and into a newly generated track before the clock hits 0. If they do not make it in time, the level will be reset to 1 and a new course will be generated.
